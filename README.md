# fhuor_text_game

Basic Idea:
- text based interface, where the player can make choices (just like in the original game)
- certain pictures of the girls should pop up when player makes certain decisions 
(i.e. buy ice cream for minji instead of mal-sook, picture of minji eating ice cream could pop up)
- sus but not +18 pictures are allowed to gain more upvotes on reddit as soon as we publish the game
